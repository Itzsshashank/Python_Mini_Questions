## Prime Number Question:
Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's a prime number or not.

### Context:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.

### Input Format:
- The user will input an integer `number`.

### Output Format:
- If the input number is prime, print " ```number``` is a Prime Number".
- If the input number is not prime, print " ```number``` is not a Prime Number".

#### Constraints:
- The input `number` is a positive integer greater than 1.

### Example:
```
Enter a number: 17
Prime
```

#### Note:
- The program takes user input, checks if the input number is prime using `is_prime` function, and then prints the appropriate message.
