# Countdown Timer Program in Python

Create a Python program that functions as a countdown timer. The program should take input in seconds from the user and display the remaining time in the format "HH:MM:SS" as it counts down. Once the timer reaches zero, a text can be displayed, ex. "  TIMES UP!!"

## Program Behavior

1. The program should take input from the user in seconds, representing the countdown duration.

2. It should display the remaining time in the format "HH:MM:SS" as it counts down, updating every second.

3. When the timer reaches zero, it should display "Time Up."

## Example

```plaintext
Enter time in Seconds: 120
Countdown Timer:
00:02:00
00:01:59
00:01:58
...
00:00:01
00:00:00
Time Up
```

## Additional Notes

- You can use the `time` module in Python to manage time-related operations.
- Consider handling invalid input (e.g., negative numbers or non-integer input) gracefully.
