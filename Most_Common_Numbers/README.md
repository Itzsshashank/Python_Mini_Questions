## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program to find the integer that occurs most frequently in the list. Create a function `most_common_number(numbers)` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the most common integer. If there is a tie for the most common integer, then return the one that appears first in the list.


### Example:

```python
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**
In the given example, list of integers contains various numbers. The most common integer is 3, which appears four times in the list, making it the most common. If there is a tie, then the first integer with the highest count is selected.
