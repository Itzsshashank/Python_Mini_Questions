# Simple Calculator Program
This is a simple calculator program implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Input Format
The program takes user input in the following format:

```
Enter the first number: [First Number]
Enter the second number: [Second Number]
Select operation (+, -, *, /): [Operator]
```

- `First Number` and `Second Number` should be valid numerical values.
- `[Operator]` should be one of the following: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division.

## Output Format

The program will display the result of the selected operation in the following format:
The `Operation` of two numbers is: `Result`


- `Result` will be the calculated result of the chosen operation.

## Constraints

- The program expects valid numerical input for the numbers.
- Division by zero is not allowed, and the program will handle this case with an error message.
- The program is designed for basic mathematical operations and does not support more advanced features or functions.
