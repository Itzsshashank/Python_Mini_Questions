## Password Generator:
Design a function `generate_password` that generates a random password with a specified length. The password should include a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The function should take the desired password length as input and return the generated password.

### Input:
- `length` (integer): The desired length of the password.

### Output:
- Returns a randomly generated password as a string.

### Constraints:
- The minimum password length is 8 characters.
- The maximum password length is 20 characters.

### Example usage
try:
```
length = int(input("Enter the desired password length: "))
password = generate_password(length)
print("Generated Password:", password)
```


**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the desired password length: 12
Generated Password: aB7!kE2vR$9p
```

This implementation defines a function that generates a password containing lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It ensures that the password length is within the specified range and then randomly selects characters from different character sets to create the password.
