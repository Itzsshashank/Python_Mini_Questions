# **Question:**
Write a Python program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a given list of numbers using the `statistics` module.

## **Input:**
- The input consists of two lines:
  1. An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the list.
  2. A space-separated list of `n` integers numbers representing the values for which statistical calculations is to be performed.

## **Output:**
- Three lines containing the calculated statistics:
  1. Mean (rounded to 2 decimal places).
  2. Median (if the list has an odd number of elements, rounded to 2 decimal places).
  3. Standard Deviation (rounded to 2 decimal places).

## **Sample Input:**
```
5
10 15 20 25 30
```

## **Sample Output:**
```
Mean: 20.00
Median: 20.00
Standard Deviation: 7.07
```

## **Note:**
- Mean is the average of the numbers.
- Median is the middle value in the sorted list (or the average of the two middle values if the list has an even number of elements).
- Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are from the mean.
