# Employee Class Exercise

This repository contains an exercise involving the creation of an `Employee` class in Python. The class represents an employee with attributes like `name`, `position`, and `salary`. The task is to implement methods for initializing attributes and adjusting the salary based on a percentage increase.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `employee.py` file to find the `Employee` class template.
3. Inside the `Employee` class:
   - Complete the `__init__` method to initialize the `name`, `position`, and `salary` attributes.
   - Implement the `raise_salary` method to adjust the salary based on a given percentage.
4. Create an instance of the `Employee` class:
   - Initialize the `name`, `position`, and `salary` attributes.
   - Call the `raise_salary` method to increase the salary.
5. Test your code:
   - Print the employee's information before and after the salary raise.
   - Make sure the code runs without errors and produces the expected output.
