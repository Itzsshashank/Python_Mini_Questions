# **Word Frequency Counter**

Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns a dictionary where keys are words in the sentence, and values are their corresponding frequencies.

### Input

- A string containing words separated by spaces. The sentence may contain punctuation and mixed capitalization.

### Output

- Returns a dictionary where keys are words in the sentence (lowercase, without punctuation), and values are their corresponding frequencies.

### Example

```python
sentence = "GitHub Repository is created, Repository is in GitHub Shashank"
result = word_frequency_counter(sentence)
print(result)
```

### Output

```
{'github': 2, 'repository': 2, 'is': 2, 'created': 1, 'in': 1, 'shashank': 1}
```

### Note

- The function should split the sentence into words, remove punctuation, convert each word to lowercase for consistency, and count the frequency of each word in the dictionary.
