## Problem Statement
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Input
Enter any lenght of Numbers

## Output
The program should print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to Length (Users input), following the rules mentioned above. Each element should be printed on a separate line.

## Constraints
- The program should print numbers from 1
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz".
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Sample Input
```
Enter Length: 22
```

## Sample Output
```
