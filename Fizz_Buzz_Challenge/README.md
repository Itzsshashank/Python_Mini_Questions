# FizzBuzz Challenge

## Context
The FizzBuzz challenge is a programming exercise. It tests your understanding of conditional statements and loops.

## Problem Statement
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Input
Enter any lenght of Numbers

## Output
The program should print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to Length (Users input), following the rules mentioned above. Each element should be printed on a separate line.

## Constraints
- The program should print numbers from 1
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz".
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Sample Input
```
Enter Length: 22
```

## Sample Output
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
Fizz
```

## Explanation
The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, it follows the rules of printing "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both three and five. The sample output showcases the FizzBuzz sequence up to 16.


**Note:**
In this Python program, the `fizz_buzz()` function iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop. It checks the divisibility of each number by 3 and 5 and prints the appropriate output accordingly. This solution provides a clear and concise way to solve the FizzBuzz challenge.
